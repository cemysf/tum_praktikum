### Notes
- Last versions of code: [training](https://github.com/BRML/2018-mlic-cem/blob/master/exercises/train-fullNet_kdd99.ipynb) and [testing](https://github.com/BRML/2018-mlic-cem/blob/master/exercises/test-fullNet_kdd99.ipynb) (other notebooks in exercises are irrelevant now, I will do a refactor soon)
